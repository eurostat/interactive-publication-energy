The increased share of renewables in 2020 was partly prompted by the decrease in the consumption of fossil fuel brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The new EU target for 2030 is 32&nbsp;% (the target is under revision).",
    "bloc4ctextp2": "Sweden had by far the highest share of renewables (60.1&nbsp;% of energy consumption) in 2020, followed by Finland (43.8&nbsp;%) and Latvia (42.1&nbsp;%). In contrast, Malta (10.7&nbsp;%), Luxembourg (11.7&nbsp;%) and Belgium (13.0&nbsp;%) registered the lowest shares of renewables in energy consumption. Differences stem from variations in the endowment with natural resources, mostly in the potential for building hydropower plants and in the availability of biomass. All Member States increased their renewable energy share between 2004 and 2020, seventeen have at least doubled their share.",
